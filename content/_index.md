          #     * CausalVul [1]: Leveraged do-calculus-based causal learning algorithms on top of existing transformer-based vulnerability detection models to systematically eliminate reliance on spurious features, enhancing causal-based predictions.
          #     * Empirical Study on DL Models for Code Vulnerability [2]: Surveyed and reproduced 9 state-of-the-art DL models on the Devign and MSR datasets. Investigated model capabilities, training data effects, and interpretability, revealing key insights to improve model robustness and understandability.
          #     * Working in causal deep learning and interpretability methodologies, my goal is to refine state-of-the-art software engineering models by identifying and eliminating the impact of spurious features, thus improving the accuracy and reliability of their predictions.
