Md Mahbubur Rahman is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on AI for Code, Software Engineering, and Causal Deep Learning at Iowa State University, anticipated to be completed by May 2025. His research is concentrated on refining software engineering models through the application of causal deep learning and interpretability methodologies, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability. His master's thesis on "Causal Deep Learning for Vulnerability Detection" underscores his commitment to advancing the field.

In his role as a Graduate Research Assistant at Iowa State University, Rahman spearheaded the CausalVul project, which applies do-calculus-based causal learning algorithms to improve transformer-based models for code vulnerability. His industry experience includes a tenure as a Full Stack Software Engineer at crowd-realty.com in Tokyo, where he led the development of REST APIs and data analysis initiatives, and as a Software Engineer at BJIT Inc., where he developed a Bluetooth service for Android and a sentiment-analysis chatbot. Rahman's expertise bridges the gap between advanced research and practical application in software engineering and AI.
