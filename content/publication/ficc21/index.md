abstract: Traffic congestion research is on the rise, thanks to urbanization, economic growth, and industrialization. Developed countries invest a lot of research money in collecting traffic data using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), loop detectors, speed sensors, high-end traffic light, and GPS. However, these processes are expensive, infeasible, and non-scalable for developing countries with numerous non-motorized vehicles, proliferated ride-sharing services, and frequent pedestrians. This paper proposes a novel approach to collect traffic data from Google Mapâ€™s traffic layer with minimal cost. We have implemented widely used models such as Historical Averages (HA), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Support Vector Regression with Graph (SVR-Graph), Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to show the efficacy of the collected traffic data in forecasting future congestion. We show that even with these simple models, we could predict the traffic congestion ahead of time. We also demonstrate that the traffic patterns are significantly different between weekdays and weekends.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The paper addresses the challenge of traffic congestion research in developing countries, proposing a cost-effective method of collecting data via Google Map's traffic layer. It demonstrates the effectiveness of this data in predicting traffic congestion using established models and highlights distinct traffic patterns between weekdays and weekends.
